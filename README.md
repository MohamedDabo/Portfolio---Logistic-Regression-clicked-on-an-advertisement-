# Portfolio - Logistic Regression clicked on an advertisement

In this project we're trying to predict whether or not a user will click on an ad displayed on a company website based off the features of that user.

This project covers a very important part of advertisement, especially online ads that companies should take into account when conducting online ad campaign, and that is customer targeting.

Knowing what types of customers to address directly will not only save the company a lot of time but a lot of money as well.
